//--------------------
// Create a Redux Store

/******** Question
The Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required argument. The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.

Declare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing in the reducer as an argument.

Note: The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize this state to hold a value of 5. If you're not familiar with default arguments, you can refer to the ES6 section in the Curriculum which covers this topic.
*/

/********* Answer
const reducer = (state = 5) => {
  return state;
}

// Redux methods are available from a Redux object
// For example: Redux.createStore()
// Define the store here:
const store = Redux.createStore(reducer)
*/










//--------------------
// Get State from the Redux Store

/******** Question
The code from the previous challenge is re-written more concisely in the code editor. Use store.getState() to retrieve the state from the store, and assign this to a new variable currentState.
*/

/********* Answer
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);

// change code below this line
const currentState = store.getState()
}
*/









//--------------------
// Define a Redux Action

/******** Question
Writing a Redux action is as simple as declaring an object with a type property. Declare an object action and give it a property type set to the string 'LOGIN'.
*/

/********* Answer
// Define an action here:
const action = {
    type: 'LOGIN'
}
*/













//--------------------
// Define an Action Creator

/******** Question
Define a function named actionCreator() that returns the action object when called.
*/

/********* Answer
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
// Define an action creator here:

const actionCreator = (action) => {
  return action
}
*/








//--------------------
// Dispatch an Action Event

/******** Question
The Redux store in the code editor has an initialized state that's an object containing a login property currently set to false. There's also an action creator called loginAction() which returns an action of type LOGIN. Dispatch the LOGIN action to the Redux store by calling the dispatch method, and pass in the action created by loginAction().
*/

/********* Answer
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = {login: false}) => state
);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

// Dispatch the action here:
store.dispatch(loginAction())
*/













//--------------------
// Handle an Action in the Store

/******** Question
The code editor has the previous example as well as the start of a reducer function for you. Fill in the body of the reducer function so that if it receives an action of type 'LOGIN' it returns a state object with login set to true. Otherwise, it returns the current state. Note that the current state and the dispatched action are passed to the reducer, so you can access the action's type directly with action.type.
*/

/********* Answer
const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // change code below this line
  if(action.type == 'LOGIN') {
    return {
      login: true
    }
  }else {
    return state
  }
  // change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

*/











//--------------------
// Use a Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions

/******** Question
The code editor has a store, actions, and action creators set up for you. Fill in the reducer function to handle multiple authentication actions. Use a JavaScript switch statement in the reducer to respond to different action events. This is a standard pattern in writing Redux reducers. The switch statement should switch over action.type and return the appropriate authentication state.

Note: At this point, don't worry about state immutability, since it is small and simple in this example. For each action, you can return a new object â€” for example, {authenticated: true}. Also, don't forget to write a default case in your switch statement that returns the current state. This is important because once your app has multiple reducers, they are all run any time an action dispatch is made, even when the action isn't related to that reducer. In such a case, you want to make sure that you return the current state.
*/

/********* Answer
const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // change code below this line
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOGIN':
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }
      break;

    case 'LOGOUT':
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }
      break;

    default:
      return defaultState
  }
  // change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

const logoutUser = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGOUT'
  }
};


*/















//--------------------
// Use const for Action Types

/******** Question
Declare LOGIN and LOGOUT as const values and assign them to the strings 'LOGIN' and 'LOGOUT', respectively. Then, edit the authReducer() and the action creators to reference these constants instead of string values.

Note: It's generally a convention to write constants in all uppercase, and this is standard practice in Redux as well.
*/

/********* Answer
// change code below this line
const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';
// change code above this line

const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {

  switch (action.type) {

    case LOGIN:
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }

    case LOGOUT:
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }

    default:
      return state;

  }

};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {
  return {
    type: LOGIN
  }
};

const logoutUser = () => {
  return {
    type: LOGOUT
  }
};
*/












//--------------------
// Register a Store Listener

/******** Question
Write a callback function that increments the global variable count every time the store receives an action, and pass this function in to the store.subscribe() method. You'll see that store.dispatch() is called three times in a row, each time directly passing in an action object. Watch the console output between the action dispatches to see the updates take place.
*/

/********* Answer
const ADD = 'ADD';

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

// global count variable:
let count = 0;

// change code below this line
const add = () => {
  return count += 1
}
store.subscribe(add)
// change code above this line

store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
*/










//--------------------
//  Combine Multiple Reducers

/******** Question
There are counterReducer() and authReducer() functions provided in the code editor, along with a Redux store. Finish writing the rootReducer() function using the Redux.combineReducers() method. Assign counterReducer to a key called count and authReducer to a key called auth.
*/

/********* Answer
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

const authReducer = (state = {authenticated: false}, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case LOGIN:
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }
    case LOGOUT:
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  auth: authReducer,
  count: counterReducer
})

const store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer);

//--------------------
//   Send Action Data to the Store

/******** Question
There's a basic notesReducer() and an addNoteText() action creator defined in the code editor. Finish the body of the addNoteText() function so that it returns an action object. The object should include a type property with a value of ADD_NOTE, and also a text property set to the note data that's passed into the action creator. When you call the action creator, you'll pass in specific note information that you can access for the object.

Next, finish writing the switch statement in the notesReducer(). You need to add a case that handles the addNoteText() actions. This case should be triggered whenever there is an action of type ADD_NOTE and it should return the text property on the incoming action as the new state.

The action is dispatched at the bottom of the code. Once you're finished, run the code and watch the console. That's all it takes to send action-specific data to the store and use it when you update store state.

/********* Answer
const ADD_NOTE = 'ADD_NOTE';

const notesReducer = (state = 'Initial State', action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    // change code below this line

//   Use Middleware to Handle Asynchronous Actions

/******** Question
Write both dispatches in the handleAsync() action creator. Dispatch requestingData() before the setTimeout() (the simulated API call). Then, after you receive the (pretend) data, dispatch the receivedData() action, passing in this data. Now you know how to handle asynchronous actions in Redux. Everything else continues to behave as before.

In this lesson, you'll implement a simple counter with Redux from scratch. The basics are provided in the code editor, but you'll have to fill in the details! Use the names that are provided and define incAction and decAction action creators, the counterReducer(), INCREMENT and DECREMENT action types, and finally the Redux store. Once you're finished you should be able to dispatch INCREMENT or DECREMENT actions to increment or decrement the state held in the store. Good luck building your first Redux app!
