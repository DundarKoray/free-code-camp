/* Question
Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.
