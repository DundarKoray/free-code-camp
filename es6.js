// Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords

/* Question
Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.
*/

let catName;
let quote;
function catTalk() {
    "use strict";

    catName = "Oliver";
    quote = catName + " says Meow!";

}
catTalk();

//--------------------
// Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords

/* Question
Fix the code so that i declared in the if statement is a separate variable than i declared in the first line of the function. Be certain not to use the var keyword anywhere in your code.

This exercise is designed to illustrate the difference between how var and let keywords assign scope to the declared variable. When programming a function similar to the one used in this exercise, it is often better to use different variable names to avoid confusion.
